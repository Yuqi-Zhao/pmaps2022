            <p class="text-left">
                To ensure high-quality contributions and an excellent conference, all papers will go through a single-blind review and selection process. Following review by expert peers, led by the International Technical Advisory Committee, each paper will be classified as <strong>“not-accepted”</strong>, <strong>“accepted”</strong>, or <strong>“conditionally accepted”</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
                The authors of <strong>“conditionally accepted”</strong> papers will be invited to submit a revised version after addressing the reviewers’ comments. <strong>“Conditionally accepted”</strong> papers that do not appropriately address reviewers’ comments will be rejected.
