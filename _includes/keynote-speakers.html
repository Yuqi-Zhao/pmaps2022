            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Date & Time: </strong>TBA</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract: </strong> What is driving our industry to improve performance? As resilience becomes a critical factor for ensuring a reliable grid in the face of significant change and increasing risks, this presentation will provide an overview of current state vs. long-term strategy for managing the challenge of measuring resilience, the value it adds to reliability and how to balance the integration of risk, regulatory and customer concerns as it evolves. It will also discuss general ideas for defining resilience metrics, applying these under differing conditions (extreme weather, climate related risk) and how this will benefit the customers of electric power.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Speaker Biography: </strong>Dr. Jessica Bian is the President of the IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES). She is a visionary leader and architect, has spearheaded electric industry's reliability metrics and grid risk assessment. Currently she is the Vice President of Grid Services at Grid-X Partners. Before that, she was with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Washington, DC. Previously, she was the Director of Performance Analysis at North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in Atlanta, Georgia. Under her leadership, a total of 18 industry-wide reliability indicators were established to determine grid reliability, adequacy, and associated risks. She is widely recognized as a pioneer and trusted world leader in the field.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Before joining NERC, Dr. Bian was with PJM, ERCOT and Westinghouse Electric. She earned her Bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from the Taiyuan University of Technology, China; Master of Science from the Electric Power Research Institute, Beijing, China; and Ph.D. from Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Date & Time: </strong>TBA</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Day-ahead operational tools currently used by the power industry, such as unit commitment or market clearing algorithms, do not explicitly represent the underlying supply/demand uncertainty. This seems appropriate in power systems with limited supply/demand uncertainty, such as thermal-dominated ones. However, as stochastic weather-dependent generation units dominate the production mix of a power system, and the impact of behind-the-meter resources on its demand becomes significant, not carefully representing the underling uncertainty in operational tools may result in economic inefficiency and/or operational insecurity. This presentation reviews current approaches to represent uncertainty in day-ahead operational tools for the power industry, describes the significant challenges faced, and suggests remedial actions.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Countries across the globe have sought for several years to develop the engineering solutions needed to make decarbonisation of transport and heat affordable.  Charting the technical road map to the smart grid is fundamentally dependant on the inclusion of energy customers in that debate.   Customer support is at the heart of all successful engineering projects and should act as our compass bearing as we chart our way forward. </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Date & Time: </strong>TBA</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>How do we feed the pipeline of engineering talent and inspire young people to think about engineering as a career choice? For the UK to continue to build home-grown engineering talent to meet its future requirements, industry and the Government will need to work with schools to ensure children from a young age experience hands-on practical learning of STEM  and subjects to encourage creativity, imagination and problem solving (all engineering habits of mind). The Institution of Engineering and Technology celebrated its 150th-anniversary last year and a lot of its focus was on inspiring the next generation. Why is this focus important and what barriers exist which stops young people embracing STEM careers?</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Speaker Biography: </strong>Danielle George is a Professor Radio Frequency Engineering and Associate Vice President at the University of Manchester. She is was President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) in 2020/21.

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Date & Time: </strong>TBA</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Abstract: </strong>China has set up the country's carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. Power system transition from fossil-energy-dominated to a low-carbon clean energy system is essential. This brings severe challenges for China’s power sector. This presentation plans to discuss the theory and method of low-carbon power systems from the perspective of carbon emission. From the view of carbon metering and tracing, based on the IPCC principles of measurable, reportable and verifiable, this presentation will discuss the carbon metering and tracing methods for power systems with the consideration of full carbon emission links and the spatial-temporal correlations of carbon flow. From the view of carbon planning and trajectory, the presentation will discuss the low carbon transition pathway of power system considering the source-grid-demand-storage coordination and the drive of carbon emission constraint. From the view of carbon reduction and optimizing, the presentation will discuss the carbon reduction benefit and coordination of different low-carbon electrical techniques. From the view of carbon market and trading, this presentation will discuss the correlation and coordination of electricity market and carbon market.</p>
