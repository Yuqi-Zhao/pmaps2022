Due to the ongoing very high COVID case rates in the UK and around the world, and the uncertainty with respect to future travel opportunities, we have decided to host PMAPS 2022 as a fully online conference to maximise the participation of our research community. We know that this will change the decisions of some people with respect to submitting papers and attending, so we are further extending the submission deadline (one last time!) until the 14th February 2022. If you have already submitted a paper, we will contact all corresponding authors directly.
